# Powershell 5.1 and WPF
An attempt at learning WPF with PowerShell, along with VSCode, Git and, Github.


Challenge:
1. To write a GUI in pure PowerShell and .Net.
2. No added custom C# code through ```Add-Type```.
3. Limited to resources that come natively with Windows 10.


# Notes

#### *It's okay to take the easier route. The code behind doesn't need to be devoid of anycode whatsoever. The UI was created using something that wasn't meant to create a UI.*
